Depends on `wiringpi`

git clone https://github.com/WiringPi/WiringPi.git

For Zero 2 as of Nov 2021 I needed WiringPi from here:
https://github.com/PinkFreud/WiringPi

Also depends on python2.7 libraries (yes I know but...)
sudo apt intstall python-dev (as of this writing installs python2.7 if not there and makes it the default)
